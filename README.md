Researches on Defense Strategy against Black-Box Attacks with Mixed Adversarial Training

Deep learning (DL) models have been widely applied into security-sensitivity tasks, such as facial recognition, automated driving, etc. Attacks and defenses concerned with the DL have gradually become hot spots in the field of machine learning and security. The black box attack, as a typical attack type and the most common attack method in the real context, can still perform effective attacks without knowing the specific structure and parameters of the model, including data sets. Therefore, a reasonable analysis of the vulnerability of the DL model and design of a more robust model against black -box attacks has become an emergent topic. Traditional single-strength and multi-strength adversarial training methods based on single-model are infeasible to resist black-box attacks. Ensemble adversarial training based on multi-model still fails to resist attack samples that are high-intensity and diverse.In order to solve this problem, the mixed adversarial training defense strategy based on greedy search strength has proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed defensive strategy have high robustness faced with the diversification of black box attacks, and performance is superior to conventional adversarial training methods.
